# Snake_Water_Gun_game 

<br>

## How code works

Here's a quick recap of your code:

-The gameWin function determines the winner based on the computer's choice (comp) and the player's choice (you). <br>
-You generate a random number (randomNo) to represent the computer's choice (1 for snake, 2 for water, 3 for gun). <br>
-You convert the random number into the corresponding choice for the computer (comp).<br>
-You ask the player for their choice (you). <br>
-You call the gameWin function to determine the outcome. <br>
-Finally, you print the choices made by the computer and the player, as well as the game result. <br>
-Input validation to ensure valid user choices.
